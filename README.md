# Digital Image Processing Project

This project demonstrates how to process and quantize grayscale images using OpenCV in Python. The primary goal is to process a leaf image (`daun_gray.png`) to:

1. Generate a clean silhouette of the leaf.
2. Quantize the image to 2-bit representation and analyze the visual results.

The project is implemented in Google Colab and includes all necessary instructions and code snippets.

## Features
- **Silhouette Generation**: Converts the input grayscale image into a binary silhouette using thresholding and morphological operations.
- **Image Quantization**: Reduces the grayscale image to a 2-bit depth, demonstrating quantization effects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Google Colab (recommended)

### Files
- `daun_gray.png`: The input grayscale image.
- `Digital_Image_Processing.ipynb`: The main notebook file containing the implementation.
